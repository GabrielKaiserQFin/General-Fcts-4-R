"# General-Fcts-4-R" 
I use the user-specific .Rprofile to source functions whenever I start RStudio. In "RStudio -> Tools -> GlobalOptions -> General -> Default Working Directory" you can find the source of StartupProfiles, which you might change to your dropbox or github account. 
In this folder you find the user-specific R configuration file, where you can place more personal functions preferences, shortcuts, aliases, and hacks, that are used regularly. In this repository you can find my Base.R profile and clone it.
